# Unity3D-Pokemon-Red-Clone

This is a ongoing personal project aiming to recreate the Pokemon Red in Unity3D.

Project is created in Unity3D_2021.1.7f1.

Pokemon models are taken from https://www.models-resource.com/3ds/pokemonxy/.

In this project I strive for the recreation of the system in the pokemon games that interact and comminicate with eachouther.

I use csv files for holding the pokemons neccecary data (stats,spawn rates for each area in the game etc.).
